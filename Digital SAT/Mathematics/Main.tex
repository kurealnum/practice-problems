\begin{enumerate}

	\item{Given the equation $\frac{1}{4}v=2+3$, what is the value of $6v-17+18-19+20$ (1)?

	      Answer: 122}
	\item {Given the system of equations:
	      \[
		      \begin{array}{l}
			      \begin{cases}
				      $-2x+by=59$ & \\
				      $5x-y=1$
			      \end{cases}
		      \end{array}\]
	      If the system of equations has exactly one solution $(x,y)$ and $x=2$, what is the value of $b$ (1)?

	      Answer: 7
	      }
	\item {The weight, $w$, in ounces, of a glass soda bottle design with a side length of $l$ inches is given by the equation. By how many ounces does the weight of the bottle increase for every inch of increase in the side length, with the following equation (1)? \[w=3.1 + \frac{l}{2}\]

	      Answer: 0.5}

	\item {The equation $8x-6y=1$ is graphed in the $xy$-plane. What is the slope of the line (1)?

	      Answer: $\frac{4}{3}$}
	\item {Given the system of equations:
	      \[
		      \begin{array}{l}
			      \begin{cases}
				      $-x+3=y$ & \\
				      $-6x+18=6y$
			      \end{cases}
		      \end{array}\]
	      What are the solutions to the equation (1)?

	      Answer: There are infinitely many solutions.
	      }

	\item {Given the equation $C = 290+155h$: A team of painters is hired to paint the exterior of a museum. The total cost, $C$, in dollars, incurred by the museum for $h$ hours of painting is given by the equation. What is the best interpretation of $155$ in the equation (1)?

	      Answer: Each additional hour of painting the exterior costs $\$155$}

	\item {
	      On Monday, Harry had $75\%$ as many toys as Teddy did. On Tuesday, Harry acquires $32$ more toys, and Teddy acquires $15\%$ as many toys as he had on Monday. If Harry and Teddy now have the same number of toys, how many toys did Harry have on Monday (1)?

	      Answer: 60
	      }


	\item {
	      At the beginning of the season, MacDonald had to remove $5$ orange trees from his farm. Each of the remaining trees produced $210$ oranges for a total harvest of $41790$ oranges. If $t$ is the initial number of trees on MacDonald's farm, what equation best describes the situation (1)?

	      Answer: $210(t-5)=41790$
	      }

	\item {
	      To rent a car for one week, a car rental company charges a $\$200$ base price as well as $\$0.45$ per mile. Jennifer will rent a vehicle at this company, but she has a $\$275$ budget. How many miles can Jennifer drive without exceeding her budget (1).

	      Answer: 166 miles
	      }

	\item {
	      A concert venue soltd two teypes of tickets for an upcoming concert: reserved tickets and general admission tickets. Reserved tickets sold for $\$50.00$, and general admission tickets sold for $\$34.00$ each. If $1520$ tickets were sold for a total of $\$64000$, what is a system of equations that could be used to find the number of reserved tickets, $r$, and the number of general admission tickets $g$, that were sold?

	      Answer:
	      \[
		      \begin{array}{l}
			      \begin{cases}
				      $50r+34g=64000$ & \\
				      $r+g=1520$
			      \end{cases}
